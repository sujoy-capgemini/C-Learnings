Pointer :
   *A pointer is a varibale.
   *That store the memory address to the another varibale.

   why use :
   *To access the modify vaiable.
   *To work with array string struture.
   *To dynamic alocate memory.
   *To pass the large data strature function without coping.


pass by value and pass by refernce ?

pass by value :
  ->
   *A copy of the variable is passed to the function.
   *Changes inside the of function do not affect the original variable.
   *Not chnage original value.

passign by refernce :
   *The address of the variable is passed.
   *original value change.

NULL pointer 
is a special pointer
value does not point to any valid memory location
int *ptr = NULL;



Strature :
   *A strature is a user define data Type.
   *That allow to group together varible of different data types under a signal name.
   
access structure members using a pointer -> this operator.
   arrow operator ->

   dot(.) direct access member 
   allow(->)direct access member through pointer


dynamic memory allocation use like : malloc
   EX:
   Book *ptr=(Book *)malloc(sizeof(Book));


Memory Alocation:
     static: compile time.(Size fixed)
     dynamic: which means that the Memory alocated during run time. (Size not fixed)


Heap Memory Alocation :
    *heap memory is controlled by programmer as there is no automatic garbage collection
     
     int n;
     int *arr[]=new int[n]; //dynamic memory allocation

   1.Memory allocation:
      *To alocate memory in Heap 
      syntax:
      pointer_variable = (cast_type *) malloc(size_in_bytes);
      malloc(),
      calloc()
   2.Memory re allocation:
      *To change the amount of memory allocated.
       realloc()
   3.Memory Deallocation:
      *To deallocate the trapped memory
       free()
