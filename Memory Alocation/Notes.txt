Memory Alocation:
     static: which means that the Memory alocated during compile time.(Size fixed)
     dynamic: which means that the Memory alocated during run time. (Size not fixed)

stack Memory Alocation:
   *Stack allocation happens in the function call stack
    where each function gets its own memory for variables.

Heap Memory Alocation :
    *heap memory is controlled by programmer as there is no automatic garbage collection
     
     int n;
     int *arr[]=new int[n]; //dynamic memory allocation

   1.Memory allocation:
      *To alocate memory in Heap 
       malloc(),calloc()
   2.Memory re allocation:
      *To change the amount of memory allocated.
       realloc()
   3.Memory Deallocation:
      *To deallocate the trapped memory
       free()
